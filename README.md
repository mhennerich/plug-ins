# The Eclipse Embedded CDT plug-ins

These are the Eclipse projects used to build the
[Eclipse Embedded CDT](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io) plug-ins,
formerly the [GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse](http://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io) plug-ins.

The project is now part of the
[Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/) and is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/).

## How to install

### Eclipse Packages

For new installs, the preferred method is via
[Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
which packs the official **Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers** release with
all **Eclipse Embedded CDT plug-ins** already installed.

Older packages are available from GitHub
[Releases](https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/org.eclipse.epp.packages/releases/).

### Eclipse Marketplace

For existing Eclipse instances, the recommended install method is via
Eclipse Marketplace; search for _Embedded CDT_.

### Eclipse Update Sites

- Stable: `https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/updates/v6/`
   This is the official release; it is also referred by the Eclipse
   Marketplace and the same content is packed as **Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers**.
- Pre-release versions: `https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/updates/v6-test/`
   Usually this site should be safe, but use it with caution.
- Development versions: `https://download.eclipse.org/embed-cdt/builds/develop/p2`
   Sometimes you can use this site to test features that are not
   completely implemented, or that might change before a final version is released.
   **Note:** This site is not always functional; use it carefully,
   back up your workspace, and do not use it for production projects.

## Run-time dependencies

Embedded CDT plug-ins are:
